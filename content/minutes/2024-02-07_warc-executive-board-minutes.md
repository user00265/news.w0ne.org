**Other Activity**
Year 2024 brings us a new Federal reporting requirement, the “Beneficial Ownership Information” report.  After lengthy reading of the government gibberish, I concluded that WARC is not required to file this report, due one of the 23 exemptions.  I pity those entities that are required to file.

## Public Service
**Provided by:** Dan Goltz, WKØW.

Attended the quarterly Winona County Emergency Coordinating meeting in January. The mass casualty exercise with Winona Health is yet to be scheduled. This summer an emergency exercise involving evacuation of a river tour boat is being planned. It is unknown if amateur radio will play a part

Plans to move the amateur equipment at the LEC to the old dispatch center are on hold, pending the County Board’s decision.

The LaCrosse Weather Service will not be holding a Skywarn training program in Winona County this year. Houston, LaCrosse, and Rochester are the closest sites.


## Trustee
**Provided by:** Mike Foerster, WØIH

Russ Marsolek, NØQK noted that the 146.64 repeater on the KG Tower was triggering itself to re-ID every 10 minutes. The problem is quite intermittent and sounds like it may have been due to the cold weather, although unconfirmed.

The new install of the beam at the Witoka site seems to be holding up well.


## Monthly Program
**Topic:** _Not known as-of this meeting_.

Change of venue for this month's meeting. Melanie Reap, KDØNTN, has reserved room 016 at Cathedral School _([352 Center St, Winona, MN 55987](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eF48rD7rokx5cGvYA))_ for the club. Parking lot is to the south of the building. Once at location, enter via the back door near the parking lot on the south side. Take the stairs or elevator down.


## Other Topics
**Proposal by:** Lance Tagliapietra, ADØUT

Due to the new change of venue it was noted to wait until the next executive meeting to propose notifying the county meeting location whether or not we will be needing the meeting room based on how it goes with the location that Melanie Reap, KDØNTN has reserved from WSU.

**Update by:** Sam Resto, KFØACN

- Going to work on automated email reminders for both the executive and general meetings for the club.

- Hamgram is delayed, but will be posted by February 9, 2024. The format is changing and will be posted on the new website location as well as email.

- Books donated by Bob Seaquist, W9LSE are with me and will be brought to the February club meeting. Proceeds are to be donated to the club.

- Items for sale by Mike Foerster, WØIH will be brought to the February meeting as well.

- Re-design of w0ne.org website will be happenning this year. Ben KUØHN has started and hit it hard, I will likely finish it after the details of the Hamgram are settled.

- Asked Harro Hohenner, KG6RLM to provide membership roster for Winona ARC to correlate and _perhaps_ manage it.

**Question by:** Justin McElmury, KFØBSI

Justin McElmury, KFØBSI noted he has never received the Hamgram, to which Bob Seaquist, W9LSE noted that it basically has to be requested due to how its handled. Sam Resto, KFØACN will look into perhaps implementing this with the mailing of the Hamgram.
