Russ Marsolek, NØQK and Mike Foerster, WØIH went up to the Rooster Ridge repeater site as the C4FM/Digital mode was not working on the 146.835MHz repeater. There was a mouse nest on the shelf above the repeater which was removed and the repeater started operating normally. Repeater was rebooted anyway for good measure.

On the next trip up to the repeater site Mike WØIH, will be bringing a vacuum to clean the shack and would like to bring air filters for the shack and rodent deterents.

Witoka remote PC which is used for controlling the Icom IC-7300 at Witoka is complaining about the battery and is showing 3% charge while connected to charger.

Requested club funds to purchase rodent deterrents, air filters, and laptop battery which was motioned by ADØUT and seconded by KFØACN. **Approved.**

Mike, WØIH, noted that there is now a power generator input plug installed at Witoka repeater site by the county in case the site ever needs to run off of a generator.


## Monthly Program
**Topic:** Setting up your station for remote control.

Mike Foerster, WØIH, will be making a presentation on setting up your computer for using the Witoka remote rig.


## Other Topics
**Update by:** Sam Resto, KFØACN

Update at the request of Lance, ADØUT, about the Winlink/Packet net ran by Ben KUØHN. Net is running weekly normally, latest was a proposed packet chat on the Witoka node, WØNE-11, ran by Ken W9GM.

**Update by:** Sam Resto, KFØACN

Ben KUØHN and Sam KFØACN went to the MVARA swapmeet and had a table setup for selling items. Items on consignment from Jodi Brom, NØOWT, had sales during this swapmeet and made a total of $161.75. Items on consignment from Bob W9LSE sold about $75 for club funds per Bob W9LSE's wishes. Remaining items in consignment from Jodi Brom, NØOWT, will be brought to the general club meeting on Thursday, March 21, 2024.

MVARA swapmeet update provided. Very busy. Won some stuff on the giveaways. The MVARA bus was there, which I got to tour with Ben KUØHN after the swapmeet.

Steve W0STV approached offering assistance with public service events in case we need the assistance from the Rochester ARC. Of particular interest was a portable repeater and a crank-up/antenna mast they have.
