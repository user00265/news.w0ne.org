## Public Service
**Provided by:** Dan Goltz, WKØW.

The Winona County Emergency Preparedness December meeting was cancelled. There is no word on the new Sheriff’s communication trailer. Moving the amateur station in the LEC to the former dispatch center is still planned for sometime this winter.

## Trustee
**Provided by:** Mike Foerster, WØIH

 - The Vibroplex Adaptor connecting the G-800SA Rotator to the PC was installed at Witoka and appears to work well.
 - There is confusion about when the HF system is in use. I put a reminder on the reflector for proper etiquette for sharing the system.
 - There doesn’t appear to be a change to the circuits on the Witoka Tower lighting system.
 - The repeaters appear to be working well. Coverage of the Rooster Ridge system appears unchanged after removing the amplifier and going to the PA that is built into the Yaesu DR-2X with the new antenna.
