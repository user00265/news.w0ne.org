## Public Service
**Provided by:** Dan Goltz, WKØW.

Dan WKØW and Walt KEØXI attended the March quarterly Winona County Emergency Management meeting held in Lewiston. The main topics were a presentation by a state organization that supports emergency management with search and recovery such as the search for the missing woman this past year, and supports searching buildings with compromised structural integrity such as a building that has tornado or wind damage. The other topic was presented by the Minnesota State Patrol and addressed traffic and safety hazards, and responder safety on Minnesota roads caused by crashes or other incidents.

The Emergency Management communications trailer should be delivered to Winona County by the end of April. After more than a year of delays and setbacks, Emergency Management has been informed that the cabinetry installation that has been holding up progress is finally being installed. WARC has been told that this communications trailer, which will have some amateur radio equipment installed, will be available for our use on our request, and can be used for Field Day and other operating and training activities.

Since the National Weather Service will not be providing SKYWARN training in Winona County this year, Russ NØQK has asked me to put on a class for the 18 new hams in the area. I am planning to do that in early May. Anyone will be allowed to attend. When the details are finalized it will be announced on the Reflector and the WEPNET.


## Trustee
**Provided by:** Mike Foerster, WØIH

Last month, the Executive committee approved the purchase of a battery for the HP Laptop up at Witoka. Battery was ordered and installed. After some issues and troubleshooting, the battery is operating normally.

Four air filters purchased as approved have not been installed -- waiting for better weather.

The club's 2-meter beam that was listed has been sold to a local club member for $75.

The club's 100W VHF amplifier was listed on QTH.com.  The amp was previously installed at the 146.835 machine at Rooster Ridge.  The asking price is $100.

There hasn't been any issues with the club's 4 repeaters in the recent past, and the HF rig at Witoka is running well.


## Monthly Program
**Topic:** The making of Russ' EmComm Go-Box!

Russ Marsolek, NØQK, will be making a presentation on what it took to get his EmComm go-box built, what it's used for, its different uses, and why it is a good idea for a project.


## Other Topics
**Update by:** Justin McElmury, KFØBSI

Update at the request of Lance, ADØUT, for the comming event for Storm the Park. April 20th (Saturday) at Whitewater State Park. Should have enough volunteers, with a few questionmarks as they may not be available. If needed, will make a call out for quick help. Marv AC9TO asked the location of the event, and was provided directions.

**Question by:** Paul Schumacher, KØZYV

Paul asked about the new hams and whether they signed up for the club or not. It was clarified that the first year is complimentary. It was suggested to invite them to a meet and greet situation to provide that face to face time with the new people. Sam KFØACN suggested inviting them to the next club meeting which would coincide with one of the more popular meeting times, plenty of space, and perhaps a show and tell. Bob W9LSE suggested to make sure they are contacted and that they are approached and reached out to during the meeting that they are gathered in.

**Request by:** Sam Resto, KFØACN

Article submissions for the hamgram are appreciated. Content is in great demand and will have assistance available for grammar and spelling for publishing on the hamgram and the online news section.

**Update by:** Lance Tagliapietra, ADØUT

Trinona 2024 is coming, has not heard anything from the Trinona organizers but wil let us know as soon as anything is provided to us.

**Question by:** Lance Tagliapietra, ADØUT

Field Day 2024 was brought up and Clare KØNY was asked to provide an update on the location he tentatively asked about. Clare let us know that he's having second thoughts and we are to move ahead with the park up in Garvin Heights or for anyone to bring up any further ideas.

**Question by:** Marv Rodvold, AC9TO

Wants to make sure we advertise it as we have, from his point of view, not advertised the event well enough. Suggestion to figure out more local organizations within the community where we can get the word out more about ham radio and what we can do.

---

**Question by:** Clare Jarvis, KØNY

Clare was asking about the possibility of getting a radiogram from the ARRL NTS (National Traffic System) welcoming them to ham radio. Goes to show the capabilities of getting a message to someone when the only mode of communication is radio.

***Updated by:*** Marv Rodvold, AC9TO

The Waumandee Time Trials has requested to let them know who plans to assist as this year we are to have t-shirts for people working the event.
