After a change in the secretary and editor for the Winona ARC there are some new _(and hopefully good)_ changes coming!

<!--more-->

The intention is to bring the hamgram, club news, and other amateur radio related content in hopes to provide content of interest to our club members and the community alike.

Speaking of the hamgram... the next issue is close to complete with plans to retroactively post previous hamgrams here to serve as an archive that is more accessible to the general public.

Stay tuned!

73!
-Sam, KF0ACN
